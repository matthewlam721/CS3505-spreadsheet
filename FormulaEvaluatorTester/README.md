# Comments to Evaluators Tester:
	This Program is for the test the Evaluator class function, making sure the program runs in the right way also, make sure to throw the error to stop when the user has invalid input.
## Requirements
-Test all basic function
-Test all error that occurs and throw the ArgumentException
-Test complex formula 



# Assignment Specific Topics
I use the dictionary function for the lookup delegate, for the multiple variable input check, otherwise, for the simple test, use the lambda expression.
